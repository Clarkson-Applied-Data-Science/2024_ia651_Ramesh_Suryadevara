## Introduction
Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent endocrine disorder impacting women of reproductive age worldwide. Characterized by a spectrum of symptoms including irregular menstrual cycles, obesity, insulin resistance, and hyperandrogenism, PCOS significantly affects a woman's quality of life and poses long-term health risks. The disorder's etiology is complex, involving an interplay of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, which contribute to its heterogeneity and the variability in its manifestation.

##  Objective
The primary objective of this research is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of a dataset containing health and lifestyle variables from a diverse group of women, aiming to identify patterns and associations that may influence the presence and severity of PCOS. Through the application of advanced statistical and data mining techniques, this study seeks to unravel the multifactorial interactions that contribute to PCOS, aiming to pinpoint key predictors that could aid in early identification and personalized treatment strategies.Furthermore, the study endeavors to enhance the understanding of PCOS beyond the common perspective of fertility issues, providing insights that could lead to more effective management and treatment approaches for all manifestations of the syndrome.

## Dataset
The data set is collected from Kaggle [\[PCOS\]](https://www.kaggle.com/prasoonkottarathil/polycystic-ovary-syndrome-pcos) from 10 different hospitals across Kerala, India in the year 2020. This dataset includes 541 observation with a total of 46 variables.
